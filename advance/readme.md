### Go Websockets

This is a simple project to demonstrate how to create a websocket server and read/write data on the established connection.

There is one extra addition to this project is, user connects to our server and then our server connects to a third party server to read/write data that we receive from our server to third party server. 

In this way, project domonstrates both create, read/write of websocket on our side + how to connect and read/write from the third party.

Use index.html to the app.
